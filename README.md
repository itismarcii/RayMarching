# RayMarching [Work in Progress]

## Description
Drawing inspiration from Sebastian Lague's Ray-Marching, this project is an extended implementation that builds upon the original concept. It incorporates additional features and enhancements for a more comprehensive experience, utilizing Signed Distance Function (SDF) mathematics from Inigo Quilez.

Check out Sebastian Lague's Ray-Marching script [here](https://github.com/SebLague/Ray-Marching/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/SDF/Raymarching.compute) and Inigo Quilez's SDF mathematics [here](https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/).

## Features
- **Nestable:** Objects can now hold as many children as desired, allowing for complex and intricate scenes.
- **Included Objects:** Capsule and Pyramid (Note: Pyramid has a broken base).

## Planned Features for the Future
- **Rotation:** Implementing the ability to rotate objects, providing more dynamic visualizations.
- **Twisting:** Adding the capability to introduce twisting effects for enhanced creativity.
- **Further Forms:** Expanding the library of included objects to support a broader range of shapes and structures.
